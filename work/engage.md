    <p>This group was facing a tough call as they approached budget season. Feedback from 6 months of exit-interview data revealed employee benefits as the number one reason employees were leaving. Worse yet, their medical renewal came back with an above-average increase and their ability to be creative with medical contributions was now non-existent. The company, with an average age of ~30, considered shifting cash wellness incentives into HSAs. Leadership was faced with a loss of premium dollars or improving company morale and hopefully, retention.</p>

  <p>We need to immediately integrate pulse surveys into their current and most utilized mode of communication.</p><ul><li>Ask one question every few days starting with "Open Enrollment is around the corner! What's your favorite employee benefit?"</li><li>Second question: "Speaking on employee benefits, what's your favorite way to save money for the future?"</li><li>Remaining questions were ad-hoc based on time of year.</li><li>Reiterate answers to the group, anonymously, targeting non-contributory readers.</li></ul><p>I evaluated the results immediately and identified two major blindspots.</p><ul><li>Far and above the most popular "employee benefits" were Bring Your Dog to Work Day, free breakfast and getting to wear jeans every day. Absolutely zero mention of deductibles, savings drivers or highly accessible medical networks.</li><li>Regarding the second question about how they like to save... they didn't. Most were still paying off college debt.</li></ul><p>Already, there were two pieces of low hanging fruit that could benefit the employer and the employee:</p><ol><li>Relative to employee engagement, my recommendation was to use Open Enrollment as a campaign launch, rather than an educational opportunity. We designed a suite of promotional materials highlighting the Total Rewards package this client offered, gutting the classic order of a benefit guide and featuring lifestyle perks and discounts first and following it up with paycheck protection insurance and medical plans. OE meetings were used to promote learning tools and resources and we rolled out a brand new resource to virtually assist employees with benefit choices based on their personal behaviors.</li><li>A communication calendar was built for the following plan year, designed around employee action items. Each communication would be matched with an interaction opportunity making way for constant feedback.</li></ol>
