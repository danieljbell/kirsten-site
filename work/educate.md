    <p>This group had rolled out a high deductible health plan for the first time the year prior. Enrollment was incredibly low despite the lower cost. Employees citing unfamiliarity as a paramount reason for choosing plans they were already familiar with. The following year, this group planned to remove two plan options, making the high deductible plan only one of two options. Being a public sector entity, this groups budget was inflexible and entirely contingent on outside council. Every dollar had been fought for. The high deductible health plan needed to be successful this year and based on a new premium, the way it was sizing up again the legacy PPO in our analysis, it would be. But what about the folks that just simply didn't understand it?</p>

  <p>We needed a drip campaign to start in the summer, assuming a September Open Enrollment.</p><p class="list-header"><strong>This campaign would feature:</strong></p><ul><li>Education about the importance and strategy of saving money for the future</li><li>Education about Health Saving Accounts</li></ul><p>I created a communication calendar tracking deliverables and dates. We'd start with interest-peeking topics such as "It's never too late to start saving". The campaign would morph into high-level, then specific education about HSAs and their lifestyle benefits. Each time a new communication would be published, it would be featured on the client's internal Facebook page, creating an opportunity to turn up buzz. The campaign would end with launching a decision-support software resource and narrating that message as "We heard the buzz. You want to know how it will work for YOU."</p><p>Ultimately, migration into the new HDHP was higher than expected. This paved the way for what is now a new onboarding presentation about the group's money-saving benefits, including a healthcare plan, formerly labeled as simply "insurance". The presentation even featured employee experiences mentioned on their internal Facebook page.</p>
