excerpt: How amazing is technology? Any answer you need is just a click or call away. Which is why everyone clicks on emails! Oh wait... no we actually hate emails. So how are we getting resources into the hands of employees who need it, when they want it? <strong>Empowering</strong> employees with resources will drive successful outcomes.

    <p>This one time, there was a pandemic... and that could probably summarize the problem but I'll elaborate. When the 2020 health crisis first began, there was one thing that was absolutely going to happen. Employer-employee interactions were going to diminish. At best, employees would be disbursed at their homes. Worst case, they'd be laid off or furloughed. And for the essential workers who got to keep working during a global pandemic, their interactions with the employer group would now be on hold, secondary to new and more urgent priorities.</p><p>With HR tied up and employees now left to navigate their brand new version of a work-life balance, we needed to leverage technology to empower the employee.</p>

  <p>Agency wide, my recommendation was to ensure all engagement solutions for at least the remainder of the year needed to be automated or have a self-service capability. We weighed HR responsibilities on a scale from "A computer can do it" to "They need to see my face", instead of "important" to "non-important" and decided that company culture needed a face. Employee benefits could be done on the computer... with some encouragement.</p><p class="list-header"><strong>We needed to:</strong></p><ol style="margin-bottom: 2rem;"><li>Support the contributor</li><li>Support the learner</li><li>Scale the capability</li></ol><p><a href="/#contact-me" class="button">Find out how I did it!</a></p>
